Introduction to Robot Framework
----------------------------------
Robot Framework is a Python based, and extensible keyword driven automation framework
	- Acceptance testing
	- Acceptance test driven development (ATDD)
	- Behavior driven development (BDD)
	- Robotic process automation (RPA)

Why Robot Framework?
--------------------
Robot Framework uses tabular syntax for uniform test cases and supports data-driven testing with built-in variables.
It enables reusable keywords, tagging for test selection, and modular testing for diverse interfaces.
It is platform-independent, supports testing various applications, and integrates with CI systems via XML output.
It offers HTML logs, Python-based custom libraries, and versioning-friendly test suites.
It provides setup/teardown at all levels and supports practical testing in multiple environments.

Architecture of robot framework
-------------------------------
Robot Framework has a different Test Libraries
The libraries can be found here ==> https://robotframework.org/
Builtin Standard Libraries

In case this a new project on the system the below requirements libraries need to be installed

Requirements
-------------
1. python --version
2. pip --version
3. pip install selenium or pip uninstall selenium
4. Pip install robotframework or Pip uninstall robotframework
5. Pip install --upgrade robotframework
6. Pip install robotframework == 2.9.2
7. Pip list
8. pip show robotframework
9. Pip check robotframework
10. Pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
11. Pip uninstall robotframework-seleniumlibrary

To install all create, a requirements.txt file and enter the libraries/packages without adding pip install, uninstall in front of the libraries
Afterwards, use cmd ==> pip install -r requirements.txt to automatically install all together than install it individually
Then ==> pip list to verify the libraries installed

Install packages
- Creating a Directory which is the Test Suit
install plugin

This cmd activate virtual environment (venv) in the project ==> source venv/bin/activate

Advantages of Robot Framework
-------------------------------
1. Open-source, operating system independent.
2. Extends support for web, device, api and database automation.
3. No much programming is required.
4. Excellent reporting, support CI, parallel execution, remote execution.
5. Robot Framework is case-insensitive

Disadvantages of Robot Framework
--------------------------------
1. Hard to maintain.
2. Difficult to customize HTML reports
3. Difficult to debug Errors.
4. Strict Indentation rules.

Test Suite or Test Case file
----------------------------
1. A Test Suite or Test Case file is a collection of test cases.
2. Test case contains test name and test steps.
3. A test suite can be saved as
	i. robot (plain text format â‡’ space and pipe separated)
	ii. robot.rst (reStructuredText format)
	iii. rbt (JSON format)


Keywords ==> functions (Builtin and user-defined function)

resources.robot ==> user-defined function

robot -v Browser:firefox -d Results Day1\FirstTestCase.robot

robot --variable Browser:edge --outputdir Results Day1\FirstTestCase.robot

To run firstly add venv with cmd ==> source venv/bin/activate
Then cmd to run is ==>  robot FirstTestCase.robot
